Completed for SE 3313 Operating Systems

The following chat application implements the concepts of multithreading, socket programming, user interface design, and semaphores. A user can locally launch the Python-based client application on their device and are then prompted to join chat room in which they can communicate with other users. The C++-based server dictates how many chat rooms are available which can be modified by the administrator and the client responds by indicating what chat room they are in. The strategy utilized was to append the chat room with each corresponding client message.
